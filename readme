# UDP Flood

This project is a simple implementation of a UDP flood attack. It is intended for educational purposes only. Please use it responsibly and only on systems you have permission to test.

## Features

- Sends a large number of UDP packets to a specified target.
- Configurable target IP address and port.
- Adjustable packet size and flood duration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UDP-FLOOD.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd UDP-FLOOD
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```
    python udp_flood.py <target_ip> <target_port> <packet_size> <duration>
    ```

    Example:
    ```
    python udp_flood.py 192.168.1.1 80 1024 60
    ```

    This will send UDP packets of size 1024 bytes to the target IP `192.168.1.1` on port `80` for `60` seconds.
